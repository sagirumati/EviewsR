# Usage

Please load the EviewsR package as
    follows:

    ```{r EviewsR}                                                                .
    library(EviewsR)
    ```

Then create a chunk for Eviews as shown
below:

```` 
```{Eviews EviewsR1,eval=T,echo=T,comment=NULL,results='hide'}                .
  'This program is created in R Markdown with the help of EviewsR package
  %path=@runpath
  cd %path
  wfcreate(page=EviewsR) EviewsR m 1999 2019
  for %y Created By Sagiru Mati Northwest University Kano Nigeria
  pagecreate(page={%y}) EviewsR m 1999 2019
  wfsave EviewsR
  next
```  
````

The above chunk creates an Eviews program with the chunkâ€™s content, then
automatically open Eviews and run the program, which will create an
Eviews workfile with pages containing monthly sample from 1999 to 2019.
The program will also save an Eviews workfile named `EviewsR` in the
current directory.
