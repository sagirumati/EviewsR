   Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Threshold
   Autoregressive Moving Average (TARMA) and Evidential Neural Network for
   Regression (ENNReg) - in forecasting the Brent crude oil price, a
   crucial economic variable with a significant impact on the global
   economy. With the increasing complexity of the price dynamics due to
   geopolitical factors such as the Russo-Ukrainian war, we examine the
   impact of incorporating information on the war on the forecasting
   accuracy of these models. Our analysis shows that incorporating the
   impact of the war can significantly improve the forecasting accuracy of
   the models, and the ENNReg model with the inclusion of the dummy
   variable outperforms the other models during the war period. Including
   the war variable has enhanced the forecasting accuracy of the ENNReg
   model by 0.11\%. These results carry significant implications regarding
   policymakers, investors, and researchers interested in developing
   accurate forecasting models in the presence of geopolitical events such
   as the Russo-Ukrainian war. The results can be used by the governments
   of oil-exporting countries for budget policies.},

   multi-regional modeling of CCC cases for the first scenario using
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based on automatic
   routines (AUTOARIMA), ARIMA with maximum likelihood (ARIMAML), and ARIMA
   with generalized least squares method (ARIMAGLS) and ensembled
   (ARIMAML-ARIMAGLS). Subsequently, different deep learning (DL) models
   viz: long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), and ensemble
   learning (EML) were applied to the second scenario to predict the effect
   of forest knowledge (FK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose,
   augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root tests,
   autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF),
   Schwarz information criterion (SIC), and residual diagnostics were
   considered in determining the best ARIMA model for cumulative COVID-19
   cases (CCC) across multi-region countries. Seven different performance
   criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The obtained
   results justified both types of ARIMA model, with ARIMAGLS and ensemble
   ARIMA demonstrating superiority to the other models. Among the DL models
   analyzed, LSTM-M1 emerged as the best and most reliable estimation
   model, with both RF and LSTM attaining more than 80\% prediction
   accuracy. While the EML of the DL proved merit with 96\% accuracy. The
   outcomes of the two scenarios indicate the superiority of ARIMA time
   series and DL models in further decision making for FK.},

   the lockdown caused an immediate fall in the daily growth rate of the
   ACC by 14.30\% and 33.26\% fall in the long run. The parameters of the
   second model show that the lockdown had an impact effect of 8.56\% and
   steady state effect of 20.88\% reduction in the growth rate of the ACC.
   The effect of reopening on the ACC is insignificant. However, the
   doubling time of the ACC has increased after reopening. The study warns

  abstract  = {This article evaluates the asymmetric impact of exchange rate volatility on the exports of nine ECOWAS countries to the Eurozone. By comparing Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) models, the study concludes that the effect of volatility on ECOWAS-Eurozone exports (EEE) is asymmetric. The study also investigates the impact of foreign income and prices on the EEE and categorises the goods and services that make up the EEE for each country based on their coefficients. The results show that exchange rate volatility has an asymmetric effect on the EEE, which comprise both substitute and inferior goods. The study recommends that ECOWAS authorities avoid using proportional policies to address increased and decreased volatility, as their impact on trade is asymmetric. The long-run coefficients of income for Nigeria, Togo, and Benin are -1.29, -4.67, and -2.64 respectively, indicating that their exports are dominated by inferior goods. The long-run coefficients of foreign price for Nigeria, Niger, and Burkina Faso are 5.32, 7.87, and 1.91 respectively, suggesting that their exports are mainly substitute goods. The authors confirm long-run asymmetry for three out of nine countries and short-run asymmetry for five countries. Only three countries have an asymmetric trade-volatility relationship in both the short and long run. The study suggests that Nigeria, Togo, and Benin diversify their economies, as their exports to the Eurozone are dominated by inferior goods and services. Additionally, the study recommends that the governments of Nigeria, Niger, and Burkina Faso provide support, as their goods and services are substitutes.},
